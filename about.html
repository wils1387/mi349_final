        <img src="Media/AustinWilson.jpeg" alt="Austin Wilson" id="austin">        
        <p id="austinstory">I'm Austin. With over 8 years experience working in production and sound manipulation, audio has been a long 
            standing passion of mine. Since starting out in high school I've turned my hobby into a profession focusing 
            on audio in video games. Currently working in the Michigan State University Games for Entertainment and 
            Learning Lab (GEL) on a daily basis I conceptualize, record, synthesize, mix, and design audio for games 
            and research projects based around using virtual environments as tools. I also take part in many extra 
            curricular student projects through the Michigan State University game development minor, hold talks for 
            Spartasoft helping people who are interested in game development learn about audio in games and the 
            process of getting a sound from nothing to properly implemented, and assist with the school's Wwise 
            course helping students get familiar with audio middleware.</p>
